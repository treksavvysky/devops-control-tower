# Contributing to DevOps Control Tower

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DevOps Control Tower as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/georgeloudon/devops-control-tower/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/georgeloudon/devops-control-tower/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/georgeloudon/devops-control-tower.git
   cd devops-control-tower
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy devops_control_tower
```

## Testing

We use pytest for testing. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and should mirror the structure of the main package.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=devops_control_tower

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py
```

## Documentation

Documentation is built with MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages. To build docs locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
